## Day 10: Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

**Description:**
This project showcases a simulation of an inbox layout commonly found in email clients. The primary feature involves checkbox interactions: when a user clicks a checkbox, holds the Shift key, and clicks another checkbox further down the list, all checkboxes in between the two clicked checkboxes become checked. The implementation is achieved using plain JavaScript, avoiding the use of any external libraries. The project encourages users to explore and experience fundamental features of Vanilla JavaScript while interacting with a familiar inbox-style layout.

## Day 13: Slide in on Scroll

**Description:**
On Day 13, we implemented a "Slide in on Scroll" effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to create a visually appealing presentation of content as the user scrolls down the webpage. The key features of this implementation include dynamically revealing images and paragraphs by adding a slide-in animation when they come into view during scrolling.

## Day 14: JavaScript References VS Copy

**Description:**
Understanding how JavaScript handles references and copies of data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects, is fundamental for effective programming. This project provides interactive code snippets that illustrate how copying operations behave differently for each basic data type.

The examples cover copying arrays using various methods to create copies, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unintentional modifications to the original array. The exploration extends to object copying techniques using Object.assign() and the modern spread operator. Shallow copying nuances are discussed, emphasizing the need for caution when dealing with nested structures.

For better interactivity, users can copy and try the provided code snippets on the console. Additionally, a script is included to facilitate running the examples, enhancing the learning experience.

## Day 15: LocalStorage and Event Delegation

**Description:**
This project demonstrates the effective utilization of Local Storage for storing and retrieving data, ensuring persistent storage even after page reloads. By leveraging the capabilities of Local Storage, the application provides a seamless user experience with retained data.

Furthermore, the project introduces the concept of event delegation. Through this technique, events are efficiently handled by designating a common ancestor to listen for events on multiple child elements. This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of event handling within the application.

Additionally, the project features functionality to check/uncheck all items at once and delete checked items. These added capabilities contribute to the project's versatility and user-friendly design.

## Day 16: Mouse Move Shadow

**Description:**
The project creates a dynamic text-shadow effect on an HTML element, in response to mouse movement. The text-shadow effect changes dynamically based on the mouse position within the specified element. Comprising multiple layers with distinct offsets and colors, the text shadow produces a visually appealing and dynamic effect.

## Day 17: Sort Without Articles

**Description:**
This challenge demonstrates how to sort a given array of band names by removing leading articles. The sorted band names are dynamically displayed on an HTML page as an ordered list. This implementation improves the user experience by organizing the band names without considering leading articles.

## Day 18: Adding Up Times with Reduce

**Description:**
Discover the total time for your video playlist effortlessly! Simply scroll through and view the total hours, minutes, and seconds for the entire collection. This user-friendly project blends functionality and style .Thanks to the 'reduce' function, it efficiently calculates the combined time, making it a smart and engaging way to explore your videos.

## Day 19: Webcam Fun

**Description:**

In Day 19 of the coding challenge, we explored creating a simple webcam application with JavaScript. The primary focus was on accessing the user's webcam, displaying video frames on a canvas, and applying various visual effects.

Key Features:
- Utilized the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access the user's webcam.
- Implemented functions to continuously draw video frames on a canvas using `setInterval`.
- Added functionality to capture photos with a snap sound and create download links.
- Introduced visual effects such as red color adjustment, RGB split, and a green screen effect.
- Addressed optimization advice for multiple readback operations using `getImageData`.

This project allowed us to experiment with real-time video manipulation using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a hands-on introduction to webcam interactions and image processing techniques.

## Day 20: Speech Detection

**Description:**

This project utilizes the SpeechRecognition API to dynamically change the background color when prompted with the phrase "change background color." Informative messages guide the user through the interaction process. Simply speak up and watch as the background transforms into a delightful random color. Enjoy a seamlessly integrated voice-controlled experience!

## Day 21: Geolocation

**Description:**
This project utilizes the Geolocation API to provide real-time information about the user's position, speed, and heading direction. The application includes a dynamic arrow element that visually represents the heading direction obtained from the geolocation data. In cases where heading information is not available, a default rotation value is applied to maintain a meaningful visual representation.

Additionally, the user's current speed is displayed, updating dynamically as the geolocation data is received. The project includes a simulation feature for testing purposes, allowing developers to emulate geolocation data in scenarios where actual GPS signals are unavailable.

## Day 22: Follow Along Link Highlighter

**Description:**
This project enhances the user experience by implementing a dynamic link highlighting feature. It involves selecting all anchor elements on the page, creating a dynamic highlight using a span element, and adjusting its size and position based on the dimensions and location of the hovered link. The code also considers page scrolling when calculating link coordinates, resulting in an improved visual highlight for links on mouse hover.

## Day 23: Speech Synthesis

**Description:**
The project is a Speech Synthesis application that allows users to customize and interact with text-to-speech output. It features voice selection, rate and pitch adjustments, and volume control. The user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience, providing dynamic control over speech synthesis parameters.
