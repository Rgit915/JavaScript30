## Day 9: Dev Tools Domination

**Description:**
Highlighting essential developer tools tricks: logging text, interpolated values, styled output, warnings, errors, information, testing assertions, clearing console, viewing DOM elements, grouping logs, counting, and timing data fetching.

## Day 10: Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

**Description:**
This project showcases a simulation of an inbox layout commonly found in email clients. The primary feature involves checkbox interactions: when a user clicks a checkbox, holds the Shift key, and clicks another checkbox further down the list, all checkboxes in between the two clicked checkboxes become checked. The implementation is achieved using plain JavaScript, avoiding the use of any external libraries. The project encourages users to explore and experience fundamental features of Vanilla JavaScript while interacting with a familiar inbox-style layout.

## Day 11: Custom Video Player

**Description:**
Explore custom video player, created from scratch with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ no external libraries or frameworks.
custom video player offers essential features such as custom controls, seamless playback options, a progress bar, skip buttons for effortless navigation, and interactive volume/playback rate sliders.Experience an immersive view with fullscreen mode.

## Day 12: Key Sequence Detection

**Description:**
Embark on an exploration of key sequence detection on Day 12, delving into the creation of interactive experiences through specific keyboard inputs. Uncover the magic of JavaScript as you craft a key sequence detector, enabling users to  to unlock delightful surprises with a sequence of keys. Making each keystroke an opportunity for unexpected discoveries on this exciting coding journey.

## Day 13: Slide in on Scroll

**Description:**
On Day 13, we implemented a "Slide in on Scroll" effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to create a visually appealing presentation of content as the user scrolls down the webpage. The key features of this implementation include dynamically revealing images and paragraphs by adding a slide-in animation when they come into view during scrolling.

## Day 14: JavaScript References VS Copy

**Description:**
Understanding how JavaScript handles references and copies of data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects, is fundamental for effective programming. This project provides interactive code snippets that illustrate how copying operations behave differently for each basic data type.

The examples cover copying arrays using various methods to create copies, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unintentional modifications to the original array. The exploration extends to object copying techniques using Object.assign() and the modern spread operator. Shallow copying nuances are discussed, emphasizing the need for caution when dealing with nested structures.

For better interactivity, users can copy and try the provided code snippets on the console. Additionally, a script is included to facilitate running the examples, enhancing the learning experience.

## Day 15: LocalStorage and Event Delegation

**Description:**
This project demonstrates the effective utilization of Local Storage for storing and retrieving data, ensuring persistent storage even after page reloads. By leveraging the capabilities of Local Storage, the application provides a seamless user experience with retained data.

Furthermore, the project introduces the concept of event delegation. Through this technique, events are efficiently handled by designating a common ancestor to listen for events on multiple child elements. This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of event handling within the application.

Additionally, the project features functionality to check/uncheck all items at once and delete checked items. These added capabilities contribute to the project's versatility and user-friendly design.

## Day 16: Mouse Move Shadow

**Description:**
The project creates a dynamic text-shadow effect on an HTML element, in response to mouse movement. The text-shadow effect changes dynamically based on the mouse position within the specified element. Comprising multiple layers with distinct offsets and colors, the text shadow produces a visually appealing and dynamic effect.

## Day 17: Sort Without Articles

**Description:**
This challenge demonstrates how to sort a given array of band names by removing leading articles. The sorted band names are dynamically displayed on an HTML page as an ordered list. This implementation improves the user experience by organizing the band names without considering leading articles.
